# top-speed-calculator

This program calculates a vehicles top speed within a gear based on user inputs for tire and gear information. It asks the user for tire width, aspect ratio, rim diameter, engine RPM, selected gear ratio, and final drive ratio. The tire's width, aspect ratio, and rim diameter are used to calculate the tires total diameter. The engine's RPM, gear ratio, and final drive, as well as the previously calculated tire diameter are used to calculate the vehicles top speed within the specified gear. Once all values have been entered, the program displays the calculated top speed. 

I initially made this program in C, but for my own sake I implemented it into HTML so it looks cleaner.
